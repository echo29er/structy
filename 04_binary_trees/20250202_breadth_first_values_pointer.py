    """
    Function Purpose: 
        Write a function, breadth_first_values, that takes in the root of a binary tree. 
        The function should return a list containing all values of the tree in breadth-first order.

    Args:
        root (Node): the root of the binary tree.

    Returns:
        list: containing all values of the tree in breadth-first order. 

    Assumptions: 
        - The tree is a valid binary tree (each node has 0-2 children)
        - Node values can be of any type that can be stored in a list

    Time complexity: 
        O(n) where n is number of nodes because:
        - We visit each node exactly once
        - Using a pointer approach means we get O(1) access to the "front" element
        - If we had used pop(0) instead, it would be O(nÂ²) due to shifting elements

    Space complexity: 
        O(n) where n is the number of nodes in the tree:
        - O(n) for the result list which must store all node values
        - O(n) worst case for the queue (skewed tree)
        - O(log n) best case for the queue (balanced tree)
    """

    ## ITERATIVE APPROACH USING QUEUE
    # Unlike graph traversal, we don't need to track visited nodes as there are no cycles in a tree
    # This implementation utilises a queue, where we work First in First out. 
    # The space complexity is O(n) for both the queue and result list

    # We start by instantiating a queue to traverse the tree, and a list to add our final values to. 
    # If we have an empty binary tree then that is still a valid binary tree and we return an empty list. 
    # If the root is not empty then we add the node to the queue. 
    # When we have a queue, we can then start saving values. 
    # We traverse the branch by popping the first node of the queue, and appending its value to the end of the queue.
    # FYI as popping the front of the queue requires shifting each element to the left once, we need to either use
    # Collections deque, or we can use a pointer. here we will use a pointer.  
    # We then add the node's left child node then right child node to the queue.
    # This is important as the queue is First In First Out.

    # Instantiate the list and the queue
    visited_nodes_values = []
    branch_traversal = [] # queue. Instead of introducing collections deque, we can use a pointer.

    # Base case we have an empty root
    if root is None:

        branch_traversal.append(root) # Add the root to the queue
        branch_traversal_pointer = 0 # Using list as queue with pointer to avoid O(n) pop(0) operations
        
    while branch_traversal_pointer < len(branch_traversal): # While we still have elements to process
        current = branch_traversal[branch_traversal_pointer] # 
        visited_nodes_values.append(current.val) # Add the popped node's value to the list. 

        if current.left is not None: # We must add the left child first as we add to the end of the queue.
            branch_traversal.append(current.left)
        if current.right is not None: 
            branch_traversal.append(current.right) # We add the right child second so that it is processed first (FiFo).
        # Add children in left-right order for level-by-level traversal
